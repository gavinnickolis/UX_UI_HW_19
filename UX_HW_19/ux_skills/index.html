        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <p>My approach to user research is defined by the goal of finding out if my projects  are working the way they were intended. Creating surveys and decisive user tests leads to getting the most out of the users interactions, and leads to functional iterations used in the prototypes later.

        <h2>Qualitative Interviews</h2>
        <p>When interviewing users, I find it most important to first get to know them on a more personal level. Knowing their interests and what they use allows me to better understand what they would need out of an app. Interviewing multiple people allows me to get a grasp of what majority people need.

        <h1>Creative Design</h1>
        <p>In everything that I do, I am first an artist. I have a background in film, photography, graphics design, and storytelling especially.  Utilizing these creative skills allows me to create unique projects that will draw the eye of anyone looking for something new and innovative.
